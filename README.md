# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zheheng Zhang

I'm a beginner & lover of programming, and a junior high school student.
I look forward to be a programmer in the future, so now I'm making efforts.

## Interest

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Go, C++, HTML & JavaScript & CSS & Typescript & Vue (in short that's front end tech), Python, Haskell, Brainfuck (just for fun) and dev tools making.

## Projects

### Lightest

[Github Repo](https://github.com/zhangzheheng12345/Lightest)

An extremely light, header-only but meanwhile string, flexible and customizable C++ unit test library. (C++11 required)

The library includes all the basic features of a unit test library, such as test definitions, assertions, and pretty output formatting.

### flowscript

[Github Repo](https://github.com/zhangzheheng12345/flowscript)

An embed interpreter of a special functional language of **FlowScript** (created by myself) written in Go.

This is my largest project (still it's small and simple).
I started it for learning interpreter & compiler technology, practising Go, and for fun.

Here I put a short FlowScript program:

<!-- highlight FlowScript as Ruby -->
```ruby
def fibonacci a b begin
    add a b > echoln -
    add a b > smlr - 10000 > if - begin
        add a b > fibonacci b -
    end
end
echoln "fibonacci begins ..."
fibonacci 1 1
```
